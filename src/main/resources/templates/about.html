            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Snails that respire using a lung belong to the group Pulmonata. As traditionally 
            defined, the Pulmonata were found to be polyphyletic in a molecular study per Jorger et al., 
            dating from 2010. But snails with gills also form a polyphyletic group; in other words, 
            snails with lungs and snails with gills form a number of taxonomic groups that are not 
            necessarily more closely related to each other than they are related to some other groups. 
            Both snails that have lungs and snails that have gills have diversified so widely over 
            geological time that a few species with gills can be found on land and numerous species with 
            lungs can be found in freshwater. Even a few marine species have lungs. Snails can be found 
            in a very wide range of environments, including ditches, deserts, and the abyssal depths of 
            the sea. Although land snails may be more familiar to laymen, marine snails constitute the 
            majority of snail species, and have much greater diversity and a greater biomass. Numerous 
            kinds of snail can also be found in fresh water. Most snails have thousands of microscopic 
            tooth-like structures located on a banded ribbon-like tongue called a radula. The radula works 
            like a file, ripping food into small pieces. Many snails are herbivorous, eating plants or 
            rasping algae from surfaces with their radulae, though a few land species and many marine species 
            are omnivores or predatory carnivores. Snails cannot absorb colored pigments when eating paper 
            or cardboard so their feces are also colored.</p>

            2 Fast 2 Furious is a 2003 action film directed by John Singleton from a screenplay by Michael 
            Brandt and Derek Haas, from a story by Brandt, Haas, and Gary Scott Thompson. It is the sequel to 
            The Fast and the Furious (2001), is the second installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, and stars 
            Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner alongside Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes. In the film, ex-LAPD officer 
            Brian O'Conner and his friend Roman Pearce (Gibson) go undercover for the U.S. Customs Service to 
            apprehend a drug lord in exchange for the erasure of their criminal records. A second Fast & Furious 
            film was planned immediately after the theatrical release of its predecessor in 2001, and was 
            confirmed with the returns of Walker and producer Neal H. Moritz. Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen, the co-star 
            and director of the first film, were unable to return; Gibson and Singleton joined the cast in their 
            absence in 2002. To canonically account for Diesel's departure, the short film The Turbo Charged Prelude 
            for 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) was produced and released. Principal photography for 2 Fast 2 Furious 
            commenced in September 2002 and lasted until that December, with filming locations including Miami and 
            the surrounding areas in southern Florida.</p>
